## Using The Discord Bot
### How To Access Your Own SteamID64
1. Access your Steam profile page (either in your internet browser or directly in Steam).
2. In your internet browser copy the URL of the website; In Steam use right click on any empty space and click **Copy Page URL**.
 1. Normally you will now have your SteamID64 already in the copied URL looking like: `http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079587349`.
 2. Extract your SteamID64 from the URL. Your SteamID64 will look similar to this: `76561198079587349`.
3. In case you are using a custom URL like `http://steamcommunity.com/id/zlyfer` go to [Steam ID Finder](https://steamidfinder.com/) and insert the URL.
4. After clicking **Get SteamID** you will see multiple information about your profile. Copy the number next to **SteamID64**.
5. You should now have your SteamID64.

### Link Your DiscordID With Your SteamID64
You only need to provide your SteamID64 because the Discord bot can detect your DiscordID automatically.

1. Make sure you copied **only** your SteamID64.
2. Go into Discord and access the right server.
3. Access any text channel the Discord bot has rights to see and read messages.
4. Send the message `~zltd~link [SteamID64]` replacing [SteamID64] with your copied SteamID64.
5. If the bot has the rights to send message within that text channel it will send a message whether the link was successful or not.
